### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Software that is maintainable is software that is designed for change. This type of software usually has little coupling, great documentation, and a care for the software developers that will come after the initial creators.

Likely I wouldn't use that specific CRUD python module in the future, but I could see myself using some alternative richer API, or maybe just the default mongo db api.


### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching computer problems is the same (in my opinion) as approaching any other problem. It all comes down to trouble shooting, and finding the specific problem to something. In software this can come in forms of debugging through print statements, lots of googling, and just basic testing.


### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

This type of work would matter for a comany that wants to view their data in a more visual way, or just at all in general. I do think the front end could be prettier, and even more functional than what I created, but my point still stands.
